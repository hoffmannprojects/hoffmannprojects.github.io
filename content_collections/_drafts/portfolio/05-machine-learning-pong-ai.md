Two game AIs powered by an artificial neural network (ANN) entirely written in C# play the game of Pong against each other.

- Two game AIs each use their own Brain-, ANN, Layer- and Neuron instances based on the same classes.
- The AIs learn to adjust the vertical paddle position by applying various amounts of force in order to hit the ball.
- Raycasting of the ball's path provides the Brains with information to better adjust for balls bouncing off the top/bottom walls.

## Details:
- Written in C#
- Engine: Unity
- Platform: PC/Mac
